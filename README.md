## Behind the Scenes

### Overview
 There is a [JioSaavn API](https://github.com/cachecleanerjeet/JiosaavnAPI) developed by [cachecleanerjeet](https://github.com/cachecleanerjeet) and fetching Songs Data via that API and then downloading it in Browser and adding perfect metadata in it.

 Thanks to [ffmpeg.wasm](https://github.com/ffmpegwasm/ffmpeg.wasm) for ffmpeg in Browser ðŸ˜‹

 Make sure you check out JioSaavn API page and :star: it if you like. People donot earn anything from this and spend their precious time developing it and release it for free. I am personally a huge fan of structural appraoch and like the repo a lot. A small praise, a good mention makes them feel a lot good and it doesn't cost anything. See right sidebar for the list of contributors to the repo.


### How it works

Song
- When you press a download button on song. it will send a request and generate a download URL from server.
- Then it will download the song asynchronously in background. as the download song will have a gibberish name and no song details.
- Then we will download the album art asynchronously.
- Then we will add ID3 tags (Title, Singer, Cover, Composer and stuff) to the downloaded song.

Album, Playlist **(not yet working. In progress)**
- Will download all Songs asynchronously as mentioned above.
- We will make a virtual zip on memory and create a folder and add the songs there.
- Download the Zip
- Somewhat Buggy

Made with :heart: in India.  
Huge shoutout to people reporting the issues and giving me pointers to look on how to fix issues. :heart:  
Special shoutout to @cachecleanerjeet for his work on enabling the extension without the CORS extension and making the download a little faster. Great job!
